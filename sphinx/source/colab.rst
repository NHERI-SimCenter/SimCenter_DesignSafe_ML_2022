Binder
============

Binder is a free service that provides researchers with a platform for sharing Jupyter notebooks. Much like Google Colab, Binder allows users to quickly and easily run notebooks over a browser on preconfigured servers, i.e., no installation is required. Binder does not require user registration to an account, unlike Colab. It also provides a familiar interface nearly identical to a locally hosted Jupyter server. However, Binder does not provide GPU support meaning that certain notebooks may run much slower than on Colab.

Notebooks can be cloned and configured on Binder directly from GitHub simply by using a uniquely constructed URL.

Google Colab
============

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser. It is free to use and provides access to GPUs, which are a must have resource for performing ML operations on practical projects. For this course you can think of Colab as a resource that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks stored on Google Drive. Below are some Colab material you should review before the start of the Workshop:

  * `Video Intro to Colab <https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI>`_
  * `Basic Colab Notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb>`_

Another interesting resource you might enjoy if you want to set up your own Jupyter notebooks
