* Day 1 - Henry Burton (UCLA)

  **Prof. Henry Burton** is an Associate Professor and the Presidential Chair in Structural Engineering in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. His research is directed towards understanding and modeling the relationship between the performance of infrastructure systems within the built environment, and the ability of communities to minimize the extent of socioeconomic disruption following extreme events. Dr. Burton is a registered structural engineer in the State of California. Prior to obtaining his PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, he spent six years in practice at Degenkolb Engineers, where he worked on numerous projects involving design of new buildings and seismic evaluation and retrofit of existing buildings. He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation Next Generation of Disaster Researchers Fellowship (2014) and the National Science Foundation CAREER Award (2016). email hvburton(at)ucla.edu

* Day 2 - Krishna Kumar (UT Austin)

  **Prof. Krishna Kumar** is an Assistant Professor in Civil, Architecture, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Krishna completed his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 2015 on multi-scale multiphase modeling of granular flows and was supervised by Professor Kenichi Soga. Krishna's research interest spans high-performance computing, numerical modeling, and explainable AI of natural hazards. He has developed massively parallel micro-/macro-scale numerical methods: Graph Network Simulator, Material Point Method, Lattice Boltzmann - Discrete Element coupling, and Lattice Element method. Krishna was awarded C. S. Desai Award for the best paper on constitutive modeling of geologic materials by the Indian Geotechnical Society. email krishnak(at)utexas.edu

* Days 3, 4 and 5 - Barbaros Cetiner (UC Berkeley)

  **Dr. Barbaros Cetiner** is a postdoctoral scholar and software developer at NHERI SimCenter. He is the lead developer of the AI-based inventory development application BRAILS, which automatically generates the building information required for predicting regional losses due to natural hazards. Dr. Cetiner received his Doctorate in structural mechanics from UCLA. Dr. Cetiner has long been invested in hazards engineering research. His latest research efforts focus on exploring the new frontiers at the intersection of AI and hazards engineering. email bacetiner(at)berkeley.edu
