Welcome to this Training Workshop on the application of ML to natural hazards engineering. This year's offering will be in an online format. A drawback of an online offering is the lack of interaction among the participants, so we encourage you to be active during the live sessions with questions.

.. note::

   The training for days 3 through 5 is organized as a series of pre-recorded video lectures and live online conferencing (Zoom). The lessons and videos for these days are provided in the expanded syllabus for these days given below.

.. warning::

   #. Videos must be watched before the online class sessions for days 3 through 5. On days 3 through 5, we will spend our live sessions mostly doing hands-on exercises ("In-class Exercise" links below), questions, and discussion. These exercises are only effective if you do your self-study assignment of watching the videos before we meet.

   #. To run several exercises on Day 5, you need to get a Google Maps API key before the class. Follow this instruction: "Using API Keys" in `this link <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key>`_.
