Welcome to the NHERI-SimCenter 2021 AI Workshop
===============================================

In this workshop the NHERI DesignSafe and SimCenter organizations provide online training for machine learning (ML) with an emphasis ML's applications to Narural Hazards Engineering. The purpose to provide a broad overview of ML techniques and inform on the NHERI capabilities that facilitate ML. The five-day workshop is aimed towards engineering students and faculty interested in enhancing their research by applying ML to natural hazards engineering problems. Through instruction and exercises, the Training will provide fundamentals and reinforce them with hands-on examples so participants gain the confidence in utilizing ML in their work. As a basis, the Training will introduce opportunities and challenges presented in Earthquake Engineering, cover explainability and deriving physics using AI, and introduce the ML techniques that are used by SimCenter in generating asset inventories for regional hazard simulation. Participants will learn salient ML techniques behind image classification and semantic segmentation, and utilize the SimCenterâ€™s BRAILS framework.
The workshop format consists of pre-recorded training videos and live, online, hands-on exercises each day. Before each live exercise session, participants are required to watch the short instructional videos. Participants who do not watch the instructional videos will not be prepared for the live exercises.

**Prerequisites**: Some Python programming knowledge is required. Participants with no or little Python experience should review the Python quick start material (Chapters 1-6) from the previous SimCenter Programming Bootcamp.
