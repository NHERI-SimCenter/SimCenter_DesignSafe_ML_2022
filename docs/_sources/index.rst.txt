Welcome to the NHERI SimCenter & DesignSafe Machine Learning Training for Natural Hazards Engineering 2022
===========================================================================================================

In this training, NHERI SimCenter and DesignSafe will provide a five-day online practicum for machine learning (ML), emphasizing ML's applications to Natural Hazards Engineering, to provide a broad overview of ML techniques and inform on the NHERI capabilities that facilitate ML. The training is aimed toward engineering students and faculty interested in enhancing their research by applying ML to natural hazards engineering problems. Through instruction and exercises, the training will provide fundamentals and reinforce them with hands-on examples so participants gain confidence in utilizing ML in their work. As a basis, the training will introduce opportunities and challenges presented in Earthquake Engineering, cover explainability and deriving physics using AI, and introduce the ML techniques that are used by SimCenter in generating asset inventories for regional hazard simulation. Participants will learn salient ML techniques behind image classification and semantic segmentation, and utilize the SimCenter's BRAILS framework.

The workshop format consists of pre-recorded training videos and daily,  live, online, hands-on exercises. Before each live exercise session, participants are required to watch the short instructional videos when available. Participants who do not watch the instructional videos will not be prepared for the live exercises.

**Prerequisites**: Some Python programming knowledge is required. Participants with no or little Python experience should review the Python quick start material (Chapters 1-6) from `SimCenter Programming Bootcamp 2022 <https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/SimCenterBootcamp2022/source/lecture_videos_part1.html>`_

.. note::

   #. Course material is available through 
      the `NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenter_DesignSafe_ML_2022 <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenter_DesignSafe_ML_2022>`_
      repository on `GitHub <https://github.com>`_

   #. You will be using `Jupyter Notebooks on DesignSafe <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/rw/workspace/#!/Jupyter::Analysis>`_ to perform the exercises.
